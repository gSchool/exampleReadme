# Background

This section contains a short description of what your project does. This will give people looking at your repository a basic understanding of what problem your site is trying to address, why it is cool and why you are spending so much time working on it.

Think of this as the story that you tell your friends and family when they ask what you are spending all of your waking time doing and why you don't return their calls in a timely manner. This also gives you an opportunity to think a bit about what you are writing before you spend a bunch of time writing the wrong code.
